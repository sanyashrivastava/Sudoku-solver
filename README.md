# Sudoku-solver
The code is a C++ Sudoku solver using backtracking. It checks if a number is safe to place, solves the puzzle, and prints the solution if possible.

The code provided is a C++ implementation of a Sudoku solver using backtracking. It first defines functions to print the Sudoku grid, check if a number is safe to place at a given cell, and solve the Sudoku puzzle using backtracking. The `main` function initializes a Sudoku grid with some pre-filled values and calls the `solveSudoku` function to solve it. If the puzzle is solved, it prints the solution; otherwise, it indicates that the puzzle cannot be solved.
